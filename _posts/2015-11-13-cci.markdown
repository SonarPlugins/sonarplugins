description: SonarQube plugin to run Oracle's Integration Code Compliance Inspector (CCI) to audit SOA projects and feed the results to SonarQube
details: Adherence to open standards and the enforcement of good coding practices are key principles of SOA governance. The Code Compliance Inspector is a tool that checks for good coding practices in both SOA Suite projects. The CCI is delivered with a set of pre-defined assertions that are based on the Web Services Interoperability Organization Basic Profile (WS-I BP) to check for design consistency and good coding and documentation practices. The CCI qualifies code as Compliant, Conformant, or Fully Conformant in alignment with those open standards and best practices.
