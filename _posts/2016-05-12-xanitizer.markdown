description: The Tool for Security Code Reviews and Automated Security Analysis
details: XANITIZER provides an integration with the code quality management platform SonarQube. It transfers all security relevant XANITIZER findings to SonarQube. It is possible to display this data in the SonarQube dashboard and the corresponding drilldown pages and time machines. Additionally, you need a XANITIZER installation, because the plugin does not run a security analysis by itself - it just collects the results of such an analysis.
