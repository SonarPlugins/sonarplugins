description: Provides architecture governance features accompanied by metrics about cyclic dependencies and other structural aspects.
details: This plugin can be used to check the conformance of your code base to a formal architecture definition created with Sonargraph 7. A free license is available to allow you to check and measure the overall coupling and the level of cyclic dependencies at the package level. Usually a high level of coupling and cyclic dependencies points to a high level of structural erosion. If structural erosion grows over a certain level this will have a negative impact on testability, maintainability and comprehensibility of your code.
